The **Manual Payment Requests** tab allows users to manually request a payment or billing correction when needed. This is especially helpful in cases where automated billing doesnâ€™t apply or when special handling is required. Users can submit requests by specifying the amount, reason, and supporting documents. 

- The tab also displays the status of each request (pending, approved, or declined), along with a history of all submissions, helping you manage exceptions in the billing process efficiently.
