Stack Console includes a robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that allows account owners to create custom roles with tailored permissions. For example, an account owner can create an "Accountant" role with billing-specific permissions. 

They can then assign this role to a sub-user, granting them access only to billing-related features. Additionally, account owners can restrict sub-user access to specific projects, ensuring users can only manage the areas they are authorized to.

- From the **Users tab**, you can view the complete list of active and inactive users associated with the project.

The Users tab provides centralized visibility of all project members, helping administrators manage access and permissions effectively.
