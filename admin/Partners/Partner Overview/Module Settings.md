## Module Settings

The **Module Settings** tab is where you define how different partner types like vendors or resellers to interact with your system. These settings can control access levels, business rules, operational roles, and other model-specific configurations for each partner type.

This allows you to customize the behavior of your platform for different types of partnerships and ensure each partner operates within the correct framework.

- You can view and manage module settings present currently. To create new module settings, click on **Add Setting** on the right-hand side of the page.
