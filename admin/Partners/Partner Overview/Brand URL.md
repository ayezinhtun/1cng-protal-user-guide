## Brand URL (Only For Reseller)


## Whitelabel Brand URL For Reseller

Stack Console provides two whitelabeling options for resellers to offer a branded experience to their customers:

### Partially Branded URL

With this option, a temporary, partially branded URL is created by default. Your customers and sub-resellers can use this URL to access the control panel.

- Click the **Login To Portal** button to access the control panel via the partially branded URL.
- You can customize the URL by updating its prefix. Enter your desired prefix and click **Change Prefix**.
- Your new URL will be generated and ready for use.



### Fully Branded URL

This option allows you to use your own domain name for full whitelabeling of the control panel.
- Add your primary domain and click **Save & Continue**.



- You can update **CNAME Record** in your domain's DNS settings. Add a CNAME record pointing your chosen subdomain to the company's private URL.
- Once the DNS changes are made, click **Continue**.



- Click on **Upload SSL Certificate**. Upload the **Private Key** file and **SSL Certificate** file.
- You can either choose files or paste the contents directly into the provided fields.
- Click **Upload Certificate** to apply SSL encryption to your fully branded URL.
