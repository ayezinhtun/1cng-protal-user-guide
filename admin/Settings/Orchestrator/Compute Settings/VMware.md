## <span style={{ color: '#003366' }}>Compute Setting for VMware in Stack Console</span>

The **Compute Setting** tab defines the configuration used to manage compute resources such as host clusters within your cloud or on-premises infrastructure. This guide specifically covers environments like **VMware vCenter**.

### <span style={{ color: '#003366' }}>Pre-requsites for VMware vCenter in Stack Console</span>

You can add a new Host Cluster to the Cloud Management Platform (CMP) to expand your compute capacity for virtual machine provisioning.
- CMP maps each Host Cluster to a corresponding Compute Category, so youâ€™ll need to create a new Compute Category for the new Host Cluster.
- First, copy the ID of the Host Cluster from VMware vCenter, as shown in the image below.

The **Cloud Provider Setup** feature in Stack Console streamlines integration with VMware environments, making it easier for administrators to configure, manage, and automate VM provisioning. Proper setup ensures efficient orchestration and compatibility with existing vCenter resources. For further help, refer to the Stack Console documentation or reach out to support.
