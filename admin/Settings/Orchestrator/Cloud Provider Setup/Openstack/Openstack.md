## <span style={{ color: '#003366' }}>Cloud Provider Setup for OpenStack in Stack Console</span>

The **Cloud Provider Setup** tab allows administrators to add, configure, or modify OpenStack cloud provider connections, enabling seamless provisioning and orchestration.

### <span style={{ color: '#003366' }}>Pre-requisites for OpenStack in Stack Console</span>

Before configuring the OpenStack Cloud Provider in Stack Console, ensure the following details are available and correct:

- **API Endpoint:** This is the identity service endpoint. Make sure from CMP server to the OpenStack setup access is available.

- **API Key / User ID:** This will be the admin user ID Or the user we will be creating/created with an admin role for the CMP.

- **Project ID:** To collect the project ID, you need to log in to the admin project and, from identity, users, and overview, collect the primary project ID. 
If the primary project is null, you need to edit the project and assign the primary project to this admin user.

:::important

If any update is done for the admin user at the openstack or VHI level, then this id must be cross-checked; otherwise, it will throw an error at cmp.
