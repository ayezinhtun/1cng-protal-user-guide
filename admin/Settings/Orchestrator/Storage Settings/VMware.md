You can add a new Storage Cluster to the Cloud Management Platform (CMP), similar to how you add a Host Cluster. 
- CMP maps each Storage Cluster to a corresponding Storage Setting, so youâ€™ll need to create a new Storage Setting for the new Storage Cluster.
- Firstly, you need to copy the ID of the Storage Cluster from VMware vCenter, as shown in the image below.
