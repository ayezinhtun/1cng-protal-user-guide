## Branch Management

The **Branch Management** tab allows administrators to view, manage, and create branch-specific configurations used for invoicing, taxation, and branding. Each branch can have its own contact details, logo, operational countries, and bank information. When a user registers from a country tied to a branch, all invoices and compliance data are generated accordingly; otherwise, the default branch settings are applied.

Brand Name: The display name of the branch (shown in invoices).
Legal Name: Official legal entity name.
Description: Optional summary or notes about the branch.
Phone & Email: Contact info to be shown on invoices.
