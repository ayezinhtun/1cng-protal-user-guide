## Rate Cards

The **Rate Cards** tab in the Stack Console allows administrators to define and manage pricing models associated with different account types. Rate cards help standardize pricing for customers, vendors, and resellers, and can be marked as defaults for system-wide application. This guide outlines the steps to configure a new rate card effectively.
