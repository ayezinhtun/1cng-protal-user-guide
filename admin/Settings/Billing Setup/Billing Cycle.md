Below is a quick summary of all supported billing cycles and their intended purpose:

- **Hourly:** Charges every hour are perfect for short-lived or on-demand resources like VMs.
- **Monthly:** Charges every 1 month is ideal for flexible, short-term subscriptions.
- **Quarterly:** Charges every 3 months are good for users wanting moderate commitment with slight discounts.
- **Semi-Annually:** Charges every 6 months are suitable for mid-term users seeking better pricing.
- **Yearly:** Charges every 12 months are best for long-term users, typically at the highest discount.
- **Bi-Annually:** Charges every 24 months are designed for enterprise clients or multi-year deals with deep discounts.
