##  IP Address Report

- The IP Address Report provides a list of all IPs provisioned within the infrastructure. It categorizes them as Active, Inactive, or Total based on whether they're currently in use or reserved.
- This report helps in tracking IP allocation, optimizing usage, and identifying unused IPs. It's particularly useful for network administrators to manage and audit IP resources.
