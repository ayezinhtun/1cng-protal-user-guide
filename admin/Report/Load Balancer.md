## Load Balancer

- The Load Balancer report tracks all provisioned load balancers in the system. It shows their current status, whether theyâ€™re distributing traffic (active) or inactive for some reason.
- This ensures better visibility into load distribution strategies and helps troubleshoot traffic issues efficiently.
