## <span style={{ color: '#003366' }}>Domain Name System (DNS)</span>

The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is a critical component of the internet that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., 142.250.190.14). This system ensures that users can access websites and online services without memorizing numerical IP addresses.
