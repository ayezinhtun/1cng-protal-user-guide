The **Storage** allows you to monitor and attach additional storage volumes to your virtual machine. These volumes act as independent, scalable disks that can be used for storing application data, backups, or other files. They are highly flexible and can be detached or re-attached to different instances without data loss. 

- To view a volume instance, go to the **Storage** tab, where you can view the instance volume and its size.
