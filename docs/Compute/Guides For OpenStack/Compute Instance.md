## Compute Instance

A Compute Instance is a virtual server in the cloud that functions similarly to a physical computer. It has its own CPU, memory, and storage, allowing you to install software, run applications, or host websites. With a Compute Instance, you have complete control over your server environment, making it flexible for various tasks. Compute Instances are a fundamental component of cloud services, enabling users to quickly launch and scale servers as needed.
