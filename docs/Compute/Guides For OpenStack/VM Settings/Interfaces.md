## <span style={{ color: '#003366' }}>Network Interfaces</span>

The **Interfaces** section allows you to manage the VMâ€™s network interfaces, providing control over both **private** and **public** connectivity. Private networks facilitate secure communication between virtual machines, while public networks allow access to the internet. You can also configure bandwidth limits, attach or detach IP addresses, and manage security groups for enhanced control.
