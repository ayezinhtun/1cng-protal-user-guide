This setting allows you to manage the VMâ€™s network interfaces, including configuring private and public network options. Private networks are used for communication between your virtual machines without exposing them to the internet, while public networks provide external IP addresses for internet access. You can also adjust bandwidth limits and assign or remove IP addresses.

----------

- To add or change your network configurations, go to the **VM settings** and navigate to the **Networks** section.  
- Click on **Create Network** to create a network. You can check the Networks guide for a detailed explanation.  
- Click on **Attach Network** to attach a network and select the desired network. Click on the network to change the configurations for that network.
