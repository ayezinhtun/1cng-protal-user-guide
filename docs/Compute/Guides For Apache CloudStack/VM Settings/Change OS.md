### **Change OS**

This setting allows you to reinstall or switch the operating system (OS) running on your virtual machine. You can choose from various OS options, such as Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, etc.) or Windows Server versions. Note that changing the OS will erase all existing data and configurations on the VM, so ensure to back up critical data beforehand.
