### **Firewall**

The Firewall setting provides a way to define security rules for incoming and outgoing network traffic to your virtual machine. You can allow or deny access to specific IP addresses, ports, or protocols. For example, you might block all traffic except for SSH (port 22) and web traffic (port 80/443). This is essential for securing your VM against unauthorized access.
