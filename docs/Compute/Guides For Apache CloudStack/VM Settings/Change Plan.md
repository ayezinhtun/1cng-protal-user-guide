### **Change Plan**

With this option, you can upgrade or downgrade your VMâ€™s resource allocation, such as CPU cores, RAM, and storage. This is useful when your resource requirements change over time, like scaling up for higher performance during peak usage or scaling down to save costs when fewer resources are needed. The plan change process may involve a reboot of the VM.
