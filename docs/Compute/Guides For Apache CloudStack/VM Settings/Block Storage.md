### **Block Storage**

Block Storage allows you to attach additional storage volumes to your virtual machine. These volumes act as independent, scalable disks that can be used for storing application data, backups, or other files. They are highly flexible and can be detached or re-attached to different instances without data loss. This is ideal for separating your operating system from application data to maintain modularity.

- To view a volume instance, go to the **VM settings** and navigate to the **Volume** section, where you can view the instance volume and its size. 
- If you want to see previously created snapshots for the volume, click the right arrow icon to expand the list. 
- To create a new snapshot, simply click the camera icon on the rightmost side. This will capture the current state of the volume, allowing you to restore it if needed.
