### **Block Storage**

Block Storage allows you to attach additional storage volumes to your virtual machine. These volumes act as independent, scalable disks that can be used for storing application data, backups, or other files. They are highly flexible and can be detached or re-attached to different instances without data loss. This is ideal for separating your operating system from application data to maintain modularity.
