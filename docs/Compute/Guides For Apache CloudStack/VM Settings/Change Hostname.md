The hostname is the unique identifier for your virtual machine within the network. With this setting, you can modify the VMâ€™s hostname to suit your organizational standards or project requirements. Changing the hostname can help with better identification, integration into domain services, or alignment with specific naming conventions.

----------

- To change hostname go to the **VM settings** and navigate to the **Change Hostname** section.  
- Enter new hostname and click on **Change Hostname**.
- Change the hostname recognized when this server is installed. For active servers, you may change the hostname by logging into the OS. We have guides for most platforms.
